At the end of each development day a nightly build will be pushed to this GitHub repo, and a live version published to the internal testing domain of [artstation.mattfiler.co.uk](http://artstation.mattfiler.co.uk).

Current development focus can be monitored through the GitHub projects board found [here](https://github.com/seanbutler/ArtStation/projects/1), and new issues can be added for this board [here](https://github.com/seanbutler/ArtStation/issues).

Issues can be commented on to provide more details, for example, the situation where a bug occured. When fixed, an issue will be closed and moved to "Done" on the project board.
